        CalSound is an independent, non-profit group of students that formed out
        of the Conservation + Tech track of the Fung Fellowship program at the
        University of California, Berkeley. Drawing from the principles of
        human-centered design, our prototype helps marine resource managers to
        visualize the impacts of manmade noise pollution in the ocean and
        provides a clear way of visualizing ocean soundscapes.
